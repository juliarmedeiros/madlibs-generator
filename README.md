# madlibs-generator
A Madlibs generator is a type of word game where players fill in blanks in a story with random words or phrases of their choosing, typically based on specified categories such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. The resulting story is often humorous or nonsensical due to the unexpected combinations of words used to complete the blanks.
